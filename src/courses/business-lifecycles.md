description: "This course uses a life cycle perspective of the firm to develop students' understanding of the interrelated nature of the different business disciplines required to establish and grow a business successfully. With the use of an online business simulation game, student groups compete with each other in growing a business in a virtual world while learning about the role of entrepreneurship, strategy, marketing, finance, business structures, management, accounting, taxation, and exit and succession planning.
